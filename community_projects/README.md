# Community Projects

For more inspiration you can also use the power of the community, like [here](https://www.pynq.io/community.html) or [here](https://www.pynq.io/embedded.html). 
- Note, since [version 2.6 .tcl files are deprecated](https://pynq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html#:~:text=Tcl%20parsing%20removed%20%2D%20please%20generate%20and%20use%20an%20HWH%20file%20for%20Overlays). This means that only `*.hwh` files are currently supported. Ignore any (online) project that do not provide `*.hwh` files, `*.bit` files are also still necessary.
